   Explanation for issues of type "NewApi":
   This check scans through all the Android API calls in the application and
   warns about any calls that are not available on all versions targeted by
   this application (according to its minimum SDK attribute in the manifest).

   If you really want to use this API and don't need to support older devices
   just set the minSdkVersion in your build.gradle or AndroidManifest.xml
   files.

   If your code is deliberately accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured
   (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called
   on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with
   the @TargetApi annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such
   as @TargetApi(11), such that this check considers 11 rather than your
   manifest file's minimum SDK as the required API level.

   If you are deliberately setting android: attributes in style definitions,
   make sure you place this in a values-vNN folder in order to avoid running
   into runtime conflicts on certain devices where manufacturers have added
   custom attributes whose ids conflict with the new ones on later platforms.

   Similarly, you can use tools:targetApi="11" in an XML file to indicate that
   the element will only be inflated in an adequate context.

[SimpleDateFormat]
        this.date = SimpleDateFormat(format).parse(date ?: return)?.time
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "SimpleDateFormat":
   Almost all callers should use getDateInstance(), getDateTimeInstance(), or
   getTimeInstance() to get a ready-made instance of SimpleDateFormat suitable
   for the user's locale. The main reason you'd create an instance this class
   directly is because you need to format/parse a specific machine-readable
   format, in which case you almost certainly want to explicitly ask for US to
   ensure that you get ASCII digits (rather than, say, Arabic digits).

   Therefore, you should either use the form of the SimpleDateFormat
   constructor where you pass in an explicit locale, such as Locale.US, or use
   one of the get instance methods, or suppress this error if really know what
   you are doing.

   Explanation for issues of type "SuspiciousIndentation":
   This check looks for cases where the indentation suggests a grouping that
   isn't actually there in the code. A common example of this would be
   something like
   if (column > width)
       line++
       column = 0
   Here, the column = 0 line will be executed every single time, not just if
   the condition is true.

   Available options:

   **always-run** (default is false):
   Whether this check should be included while editing.

   While you're editing, it's common to have a temporary situation where you have suspicious indentation scenarios -- e.g. you start typing an `if` statement on the line above something you want to make conditional, and you haven't indented it yet. It can be distracting and misleading to suddenly have both statements light up as errors. Therefore, lint will avoid including this check when running on the fly in the editor, unless it looks like the file has not been recently edited. With this option, you can turn it on in all cases.

   To configure this option, use a `lint.xml` file with an <option> like this:

   ```xml
   <lint>
       <issue id="SuspiciousIndentation">
           <option name="always-run" value="false" />
       </issue>
   </lint>
   ```

                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "TrimLambda":
   The Kotlin standard library trim() call takes an optional lambda to specify
   which characters are considered whitespace.

   When converting Java code to Kotlin code, the converter will convert calls
   for Java's s.trim() into s.trim() { it <= ' ' }. This preserves the exact
   semantics of the Java code, but is likely not what you want: the default in
   Kotlin uses a better definition of what constitutes a whitespace character
   (Char::isWhitespace) and also results in less bytecode at the call-site.
